# Transaction Strategy Fix

## Issue
Session completion was failing with the error:
```
The configured execution strategy 'SqlServerRetryingExecutionStrategy' does not support user-initiated transactions. Use the execution strategy returned by 'DbContext.Database.CreateExecutionStrategy()' to execute all the operations in the transaction as a retriable unit.
```

## Root Cause
The `CreditService` was using manual transaction handling with `BeginTransactionAsync()`, `CommitTransactionAsync()`, and `RollbackTransactionAsync()`, but Entity Framework Core's retry execution strategy (`SqlServerRetryingExecutionStrategy`) doesn't support user-initiated transactions.

## Solution
Removed manual transaction handling and let Entity Framework Core handle transactions automatically through `SaveChangesAsync()`. EF Core automatically wraps all changes in a single transaction when `SaveChangesAsync()` is called.

## Changes Made

### 1. **TransferCreditsAsync Method**
- Removed `BeginTransactionAsync()`, `CommitTransactionAsync()`, and `RollbackTransactionAsync()` calls
- Let EF Core handle the transaction automatically
- All operations (update pending transaction + create teacher transaction) are now saved in a single `SaveChangesAsync()` call

### 2. **RefundCreditsAsync Method**
- Removed manual transaction handling
- Simplified to use single `SaveChangesAsync()` call

### 3. **TransferCreditsAsync (Direct Transfer) Method**
- Removed manual transaction handling
- Simplified to use single `SaveChangesAsync()` call

## Benefits
- ✅ Compatible with EF Core's retry execution strategy
- ✅ Automatic transaction management by EF Core
- ✅ Simpler code without manual transaction handling
- ✅ Better error handling and retry capabilities
- ✅ No more transaction conflicts

## Files Modified
- `src/SkillSwap.Infrastructure/Services/CreditService.cs`

## Result
Session completion should now work correctly without transaction errors. The credit transfer will be handled atomically by EF Core's automatic transaction management.

## Testing
Try completing a session again. The transaction error should be resolved and credits should be properly transferred to the instructor.
