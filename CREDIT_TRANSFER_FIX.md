# Credit Transfer Fix

## Issue
Credits were being subtracted from the student when booking a session, but not being added to the instructor when the session was completed.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Transaction Order Issue**
The `TransferCreditsAsync` method was calculating the teacher's balance BEFORE the student's pending transaction was completed and saved. This created a race condition where the teacher's balance calculation used stale data.

### 2. **Silent Failure in Session Completion**
The `SessionService.CompleteSessionAsync` method was catching credit transfer exceptions and only logging them as warnings, but not failing the session completion. This meant sessions could be marked as completed even if credit transfer failed.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Transaction Order in CreditService**
Updated `TransferCreditsAsync` to:
- Complete the student's pending transaction first
- Save the student transaction to the database
- THEN calculate the teacher's balance with updated data
- Create the teacher's transaction with accurate balance

```csharp
// Save the student transaction first to ensure balance calculations are accurate
await _unitOfWork.SaveChangesAsync();

// Now create transaction for the teacher with updated balance
var teacherBalance = await GetUserCreditBalanceAsync(toUserId);
```

### 2. **Added Proper Error Handling in SessionService**
Updated `CompleteSessionAsync` to:
- Check the return value of `TransferCreditsAsync`
- Rollback session completion if credit transfer fails
- Throw proper exceptions instead of silently failing

```csharp
var transferResult = await _creditService.TransferCreditsAsync(...);
if (!transferResult)
{
    throw new InvalidOperationException("Failed to transfer credits to teacher");
}
```

### 3. **Added Debug Logging**
Added comprehensive logging to track the credit transfer process:
- Log transfer parameters
- Log pending transaction status
- Log balance calculations
- Log success/failure of operations

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Session Booking**: Credits held in escrow (pending status)
2. **Session Completion**: 
   - Student's pending transaction becomes completed
   - Teacher receives new "Earned" transaction
   - Both transactions have correct balance calculations
3. **Error Handling**: If credit transfer fails, session completion is rolled back

## Files Modified
- `src/SkillSwap.Infrastructure/Services/CreditService.cs`
- `src/SkillSwap.Infrastructure/Services/SessionService.cs`

## Testing
The fix includes debug logging that will help identify any remaining issues. Check the console output when completing sessions to verify:
- Pending transaction is found
- Student balance is calculated correctly
- Teacher balance is calculated correctly
- Both transactions are created successfully

## Result
✅ Credits are now properly transferred from student to teacher upon session completion
✅ Proper error handling prevents silent failures
✅ Debug logging helps identify any remaining issues
